Description:
- This is a fan made Pokemon game where players can battle randomly generated AI and their Pokemon
- It connects the player's profile to their facebook profile to get player image, and includes a level progression feature

Motivation:
- We wanted to make a low stress and easily accessible game for ourselves
- We think Pokemon is awesome and there is not enough Pokemon fan games out there
- There was also the need to learn how to create a simple user authentication response and utilizing several APIs we were not familiar with

Results:
- An easy to play game where the user can choose a starter Pokemon to battle against a randomly generated opponent
- Users can log in using their Facebook account, and their information is stored in our Firebase database
