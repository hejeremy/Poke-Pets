Description:
- This is a fan made Pokemon game where players can battle randomly generated AI and their Pokemon
- It connects the player's profile to their facebook profile to get player image, and includes a level progression feature

Motivation:
- We wanted to make a low stress and easily accessible game for ourselves
- We think Pokemon is awesome and there is not enough Pokemon fan games out there
- There was also the need to learn how to create a simple user authentication response and utilizing several APIs we were not familiar with

Results:
- An easy to play game where the user can choose a starter Pokemon to battle against a randomly generated opponent
- Users can log in using their Facebook account, and their information is stored in our Firebase database

Team Effors:
- At the beginning we had macro goals where we assigned sections such as frontend menu, battling, and backend user authentication to each person
- Eventually we started borrowing functions from each others' javascript and borrowing css styling as it became convenient for our different sections to become standardized

Individual Responsibilities:
- Alec handled the backend Facebook user authentication and Firebase storage
- Caroline created the myPokemon menu that displays all Pokemon currently owend by the player, and designed a majority of the css styling we use.
- Jeremy created the current battle system where you face off against a random AI

Improvements:
- If we had more time, we could have done extensive compatibility testing to make sure it work properly on any versions of browsers
- Currently as it stands, inidivdual Pokemon moves are not scalable. During battle, the player can only use 1 potion. If we had more time we could have made a scalable array for Pokemon moves and implement a bag feature that holds items that can be used during battle.
- We also had a shop feature where players can spend their currency to buy items and additional Pokemon, but that idea was scrapped due to time constraints.
